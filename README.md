# Code Refactoring

## Description
In this code I refactored it so that it was not only meets accesibility standards but also simplified code in both HTML and CSS. This included grouping selectors, changing labels, and fixing a link. Code refactoring means you can make edits to the code with out disturbing how the website looks when opened on a browser. Doing so also makes the code easier to read for future coworkers who look at the code later also known as the **Scout Rule**&mdash;.



## Usage

![The following Horiseon webpage includes clickable links in the navigation bar and meets accessibility standards](01-html-css-git-homework-demo.png)
**Note**: This layout is designed for desktop viewing, so you may notice that some of the elements don't look like the mock-up at a resolution smaller than 768px.


## installation

There was a given starter code which was messy and unorganized with many problems with in the code. I first organized the code with semantic HTML elements from there I fixed any broken code with in the HTML. Then I moved to the CSS file in which I de-cluttered all the uneccessary code and condensed it so the code was more efficient.lastly I made sure the website was up to accessibility standards so people with disabilities can still read the webpage effectively.
